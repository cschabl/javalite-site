Considering that I started the JavaLite frameworks back in 2009, a blog is long overdue. 
Early on, [I published a few articles](http://igorpolevoy.blogspot.com/), however, 
between various projects, jobs and startups, I was way too busy to also maintain a blog for JavaLite. 

Nonetheless, there are releases, important announcements, collaboration and other stuff that needs to be published, 
so I'm looking to bootstrap this again, off we go!
