<p>Considering that I started the JavaLite frameworks back in 2009, a blog is long overdue. Early on, <a href="http://igorpolevoy.blogspot.com/">I published a few articles</a>, however, between various projects, jobs and startups, I was way too busy to also maintain a blog for JavaLite.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are releases, important announcements, collaboration and other stuff that needs to be published, so I'm looking to bootstrap this again, off we go!</p>
